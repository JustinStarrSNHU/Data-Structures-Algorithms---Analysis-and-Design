# Hello, and welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms / Analysis and Design Repository of my Academic Projects🖐️

Learned various data structures (e.g. Vectors, Hash Tables, Linked Lists), advanced algorithms (e.g. quick sort, selection sort, and BSTs), and comparison of time complexities to aid in problem-solving.

Project One located in M6 <br>
Project Two located in M7 <br><br>

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course

- For the first project of the course, we were asked to apply non-coding development methodologies, such as pseudocode, to outline an algorithmic design, and evaluate complex data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary data structures) that solve a given problem using advanced algorithmic designs. Pseudocode was written for each of the three types of data structures for how a program would open a file, read the data from the file, parse each line, and check for formatting errors. The pseudocode designed for each type of data structure also showed how to create course objects for the program so that one course object holds data from a single line from the input file, as well as pseudocode for printing out course information and prerequisites using each type of data structure. Additionally, pseudocode was written for the program's menu, as well as the functions needed to print out the list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. After completing the pseudocode, a worst-case time complexity analysis was conducted for the various data structures and their functions. Based on this analysis a recommendation was made for which data structure should be used when creating the program for project two, which was determined to be a binary data structure.

- For project Two, we were asked to write a program for ABCU that helps its computer science advisors access course information for students. We were asked to implement the recommended data structure from Project One for handling courses and their data. The program needed to successfully and correctly read data from a course data file, implement a menu that prompts a user for menu options, develop working code to load data from the file into the data structure, develop working code to sort and print out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order, develop working code to print course information and apply industry-standard best practices in the code design. 

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

- I approached the problem by learning how each of the different data structures works and in what situations it is appropriate to implement them. After completing weekly assignments that addressed writing working software for each type of data structure, I then could write pseudocode for how each data structure could be implemented into the projects. Based on this pseudocode, I completed the runtime analysis for the worst-case time complexity for each data structure, which then enabled me to make the appropriate recommendation for which data structure to implement into the final project, a binary search tree or binary data structure. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

- Many of the activities throughout this course incorporated pseudocode to aid in the completion of the activities. Utilizing this pseudocode along with pseudocode provided in our course textbook for the various algorithms helped ensure the proper implementation of the various algorithms used in each of the data structures that were explored. It was essential throughout the weeks that I allowed myself an ample amount of time for debugging because most of the problems I encountered were due to having a return in the wrong place or not having a needed if statement to check for a specific condition. Additional research was needed at times, however, utilizing the provided resources and following in-line comments, and conducting my own research when necessary contributed to my overall success throughout this course.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

- My work on this project expanded my knowledge of how I can use a variety of data structures to store and manage data. Until now, I had not previously worked with vectors, hash tables, or binary search trees. Previously I have been using lists, and having this newly acquired knowledge greatly enhances my capabilities of various ways to manage data as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different data structures. The work on this project has changed my thinking about how I will design software in the future, knowing that there are multiple ways to handle data and that different situations may benefit more from different types of data structures.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

- As I continue my learning experience in computer science, I am starting to truly understand what it means to write code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. For instance, when I first started learning to program, I would write an entire program in one function, the main. I have since learned how this does not make for good code that is maintainable and adaptable. I have learned that functions should serve a primary purpose or one specific task, which helps keep code adaptable. Following industry-standard best practices, such as the use of in-line comments, following standard naming conventions, and proper spacing helps keep code readable so that other developers who might need to understand what is happening in your code can.
